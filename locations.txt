Dog with pumpkins and a witches hat in the month of Halloween

Behind an ancient Japanese shrine in the snow 

On the back of a robot near the on off switch

Under the place where a boy keeps his books to read beside the toilet

Under the sandpit in Maisie's house

Behind the mirror where dad checks the pipes. 

Inside a small pumpkin with a smile

Under the bird house

On the red dragon in Dragon Wood

Under the golden buddah
